# The Box Cox Transformation

You have a target variable $Y$. 
Predict it. 

That summarizes all the strife we have ever.
If there is a deterministic formula for it, we have an $\mathcal{O}(1)$ solution.
If there is a computable solution then something of more complexity.

Sometimes determinism is absent. We either do not have enough informmation, or the computation method deliberately trades complexity for determinism.

Either way, our new task looks something as follows-

$$
    Y = \hat{\mu} + \hat{\varepsilon}
$$
