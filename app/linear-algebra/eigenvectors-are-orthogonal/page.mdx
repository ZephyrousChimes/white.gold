## The Eigenvectors

We know eignevectors map to themselves, just scaled.

But let us take a deeper journey into it. What it looks like, what it feels like.

Think of a transformation. A fully diagonizable transformation will feel like holding each eignevector, and one by one, pulling them along themselves. 
Do this for all of them, and you have the final transformation.

### A "nice" matrix $\leftrightarrow$ Orthogonal matrix

The above mental model might have set you to think that what else can happen?
The only enemy of such a pretty transformation is some form of rotation. But other than that, we can always work with 
nice matrices. The formal name for this "niceness" is **diagonizable**.

> Diagonizable means orthogonal eigenvalues. It can happen only with symmetric matrices.

This has implications. We can just remove one of the
