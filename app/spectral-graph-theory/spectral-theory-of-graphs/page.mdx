# The Spectral Theory of Graphs

- Graphs
- Energy potential at each node
- **Assume** how this energy is exchanged at each time step, $f_i - f_j$ for each edge.
- Take a divergence of this exchange and we get the combinatorial laplacian
- The issue with all these types of formulations is that they see graph as a way of energy transfer. This makes a very grounding assumption of what those edges mean, which in generality can mean anything, not just interaction edges.
